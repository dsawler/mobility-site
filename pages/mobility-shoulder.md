- MWOD: The Biggest Shoulder Problem of Them All We’ve got three videos for you today. The first is my absolute favorite way to reclaim that missing IR. It requires a Voodoo Floss band which you can pick up at Roguefitness.com. The second video is me demonstrating on Jesse Burdick of Powerwod.com, that you can in fact have Normal range of motion and still be strong. The final video is a world record mwod attempt. It’s a mob mob smash party at the Reebok Crossfit Games. (Smash Mob?) We are working on IR as a group, with no equipment.
- DeFrancosGym.com: Improve Shoulder Health NOW! Three super simple exercises that virtually saved my shoulders. All 3 exercises ACTIVATE/STRENGTHEN the musculature of the upper back, external rotators, while lengthening the internal rotators. #WINNING #1) Lying "Y-Handcuffs" - (I made up this name because it's the only way my athletes remember how to do this exercise!) #2) Mini Band Face Pull + External Rotation #3) Mini Band Pull-aparts (externally rotated)
- Tennis Ball Mobilization- Back of Shoulder In this post I’m going to show you how to use the tennis ball to mobilize the muscles in the back of your shoulder. This includes the small rotator cuff muscles as the sneak through the shoulder from their origin on the back of the shoulder blade, as well as, the larger deltoid, lat dorsi, and tricep muscles. The goal with this mobilization is to anchor one end of the muscle down and then actively stretch out the rest the muscle against it.
- Rotator Cuff Mobilizations In this post I’m going to show you mobilization techniques specifically for the tiny muscles of the rotator cuff. This is a two part move to get both the internal and external rotation muscles. For one of these moves you will need some resistance tubing and a surface to prop your arm up on.
