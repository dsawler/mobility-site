General mobility describes the ability to safely, freely, and easily move through space-time.1 (add superscript and link)

Mobility is range of motion at the joint as it relates to the muscle.2(add superscript and link)

###What is Flexibility?
---
Flexibility is the ability to take a joint through a range of motion passively. For example, if someone takes you through a hamstring stretch whilst you are lying on your back, it is a test of your hamstring flexibility. They are passively assisting you in taking your joint through its range of motion.3

Flexibility is more like length at the muscle, or range of motion, at the muscle.4
