General mobility describes the ability to safely, freely, and easily move through space-time. [1]  

Mobility is range of motion at the joint as it relates to the muscle. [2]  

### What is Flexibility?
---
Flexibility is the ability to take a joint through a range of motion passively. For example, if someone takes you through a hamstring stretch whilst you are lying on your back, it is a test of your hamstring flexibility. They are passively assisting you in taking your joint through its range of motion. [3]

Flexibility is more like length at the muscle, or range of motion, at the muscle. [4]
